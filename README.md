##  CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

- Jenkins is configured with a **Jenkinsfile** to automate build, test, and deploy.

  3. Push to Docker Hub
  4. Deployment via `kubectl` to Kubernetes cluster

### 🔧 Sample Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t client ./client'
                sh 'docker build -t server ./server'
            }
        }
        stage('Push') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerhub', ...)]) {
                    sh 'docker push your-user/client'
                    sh 'docker push your-user/server'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/'
            }
